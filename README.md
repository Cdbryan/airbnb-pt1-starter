# Kavholm AirBnB Clone Lab 1 

For this lab, you will be creating a clone of AirBnB - a modern booking platform for local bed and breakfasts. This competitor application will be geared towards celebrities only, in the hopes of attracing the highest revenue customers to the platform. Celebrities should be able to sign up, list any of their personal residences, and let other celebrities book trips to stay in their houses.

We'll start on the backend side of things and focus on writing tests to verify that the backend is working correctly, as well as use TDD to implement new functionality in our application.
